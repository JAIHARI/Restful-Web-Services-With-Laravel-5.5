## Introduction

This is full functional rest web services created using Laravel 5.5. The rest api is for creating meeting

## Authentication

We are using <a href="https://github.com/tymondesigns/jwt-auth/">jwt-auth</a> for authentication using json web tokens. We are using postman to test our api.

## Our Sample Routes

- http://localhost:8000/api/v1/user/signin
- http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meeting
- http://localhost:8000/api/v1/meeting/1

NB: <p>You have to replace localhost with your own server</p>

## Conclusion

At this point I believe you can take it further by creating a front-end using framework like <a href="https://vuejs.org/">vue</a>. As a developer you have to take it little further by learning new concept.
